For Introduction to Databases (CSC675), we were required to build a database of our choosing. Below is the ER diagram that we were required to create. The database was suppost to has at least 4 entities and 3 relationships. 

The ER diagram below was designed for a car dealership to keep track of its business.

In this repository you will find the files needed to create the database. There are also some SQL code to insert into the database. I recommend using SQLite3 as I've already created the database which is located in the SQLite3_database folder.
